\section{Introduction}
We will perform an experiment where a subject is looking at a finite amount of points under different conditions. These conditions are combinations of moving the head or keeping it still and an infrared light being on or off. The images will then be processed to identify the edges of the eye and the center of the pupil. We can then extract eye images using the feature data.  We can then run machine learning algorithms on the data and analyze the results to determine if we are able to perform gaze estimation.

This report will explain concepts of machine learning utilized in this project, the experiment in more detail, how the results can be evaluated, possible threats to validity and the final results.
