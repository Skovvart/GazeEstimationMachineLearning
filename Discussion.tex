\subsection{Internal}

Learning only tested on eyes from 2 people.
Eye corners and pupil center was manually marked, not all marked 100\% accurately.
Webcam images were not of very high quality. This makes the potential usability cheaper which is a plus, but some detail may be lost.
Our test setup required the test-subjects to sit a certain distance from the camera for the infrared lights to be visible. This had the effect that the eye were a smaller part of the input images than they could have been.
To simplify learning, images were scaled down to 20x20 pixels. Information lost that could potentially have an impact on learning. Trade-off.
Noise due to loose experiment setup. Even during head-still images the heads moved slightly etc.

\subsection{External}
Other ethnicities (in particular asians?) could potentially give different results. Given proper test-setup, it is unlikely to have any significant effect.
