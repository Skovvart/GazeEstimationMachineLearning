In this paper we attempt to perform Principal Component on a set of eye-images and evaluate the feasibility of performing discrete gaze estimation using this approach.
Gaze estimation has many applications, for example allowing the disabled to type with their eyes, and using machine learning to perform gaze estimation could reduce its cost.
The data used for learning is gathered under an experiment where test-subjects are looking at 4 points placed in a straight line marked with both infra-red- and coloured lights.
Our results show that it is possible to separate right from left in more than 80\% of cases, but correctly separating all 4 points can only be done in about 40\% of the cases.
Further work can hopefully increase the accuracy in both cases.
